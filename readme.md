# Mailto Me Not

### What is Mailto Me Not?

Mailto Me Not is a MacOS status bar application which intercepts all "mailto:" url scheme requests. Mailto Me Not saves the data in a list so you can quickly copy the email address (and other details) from the menu bar popover for the latest URLs you've clicked.

### Why did I build Mailto Me Not?

I don't use native email clients and it becomes frustrating when every time I accidentally click a mailto link that Mac's Mail application feels the need to open and cause everything to hang.

### How To Install

1. Install Mailto Me Not.app in the /Applications folder
2. Run the app at least once, you may need to bypass the app security thing
3. (Unfortunately) Open the native mac Mail client. In the menu bar navigate to Mail -> Preferences and select "Mailto Me Not" as the default email viewer
